<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>"Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) translates to House of World Cultures, but is also known as the Pregnant Oyster by people in Berlin due to its structure and shape on the outside. The HKW is a forum/convention used for all forms of art, ranging from dance, theater, music, film, literature, etc. to be displayed. Built with the purpose for people to come together and discuss social and artistic topics/ideas representing European and non-European cultures, the HKW condemns the notions of hate speech or hateful ideas to be spread or represented within its values."

<h2>History</h2>
<p>"The site of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt has had a long and eventful history before the HKW came to be. During the 1700s, the site was used for vendors catering to royals and elites. Located between buildings neighboring the Reichstag and hunting grounds used by royals, it later became a central assembly area for protestors to gather and organize themselves for the German Revolution in 1848-49. However, as the area and city surrounding the site continued to grow with business during the reign of the Weimar Republic, the site was officially established in 1919 as the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexology) by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. The institute stood for about 20 years before it was targeted during the rise of the National Socialist's power, as part of the movement for book burnings and rejection for many modern ideas the institute represented. The institute was completely ruined and burned down during World War II as it faced many bombing raids in the area. Following the war, the U.S. built the structure that is known as the HKW in 1957, but was originally gifted to West Berlin to be the Kongresshalle. The building was then set to be repaired in 1987 after some architectural issues were discovered, finally establishing the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in 1989."

<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>"The rich history of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt holds heavy significance for the people of Berlin, signifying the evolution of their fears, concerns, and ideas from the late 18th century to the middle of the 20th century. What once was a space that only held royals and the elite transformed into a site that embraces and encourages the discussion of social and cultural exchanges. During the German Revolution, the site represented a perfect location for people to ensure their voices and concerns were heard, and transformed into an institute where more modern ideas were pushed forward. Following WWII, the Kongresshalle became a symbol of freedom and democracy in West Berlin, allowing people to adopt a new way of thinking and politics. Finally, the HKW was established to fully capture the different cultures and arts forms that make up the world we now live in. "

        <h2>Modern City</h2>
        <p>"For artists, the HKW was a focal point of expression of different forms of art without fear of prejudice, marking it as a great step towards a “Modern City”. However, the site of the HKW drew mixed reactions throughout its history due to its rapid social, cultural, and political significance. While many bourgeois citizens feared its location to be too open and free form for the public during the German Revolutions, many were elated to be able to access the well-sought after location. As for the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, the institute was met with mainly negative reactions as it was the first attempt at “establishing sexual science”, and was later the target of fascist students who looked to burn every trace of it. As the HKW was established, people expressed their hope and fears centered around the “American” ideas of democracy, but eventually gave into the free exchange of cultures, social ideas, and arts."</p>
