<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>"The Philharmonic Orchestra was founded first as a reaction to unfair working conditions, but as time has gone on its presence has been a cornerstone to the city of Berlin, and the buildings that it has called home have been host to millions across the 143 years of the orchestra’s life."

<h2>History</h2>
<p>"The Orchestra was first founded in 1882  in response to unfair working conditions, structured in a way similar to modern 'co-ops’, with each of the component members being part-owners of the new orchestra. Humorously naming themselves “The Former Bilse’s Ensemble”, they struggled for existence until that summer where they negotiated a contract to use a near-defunct roller skating rink as their primary concert venue. From there decades of renovations and improvements followed, as the first iteration of one of Germany’s most important concert halls was born as the “Berliner Philharmonie”.
<br>

While photos of the first Philharmonie’s outside were rarely taken, and are today scarcely available outside of private collections, the building has a legacy that is defined by its interior sculpted across decades to better acoustics:

        <p>Over the 63 years between the concert hall’s creation as such, and the near demolition at the hands of Allied air raids the hall would become a landmark for the city of Berlin, increasing performances during WW1 to promote morale, totaling 631 across the Great War’s four years – with at least 102 of these concerts existing explicitly as backdrops for charity drives in support of various groups. At the end of the war, Germany entered into an unsteady era of change, with the Spanish Flu affecting millions, the Sparticist Uprising, the fall of Germany’s constitutional monarchy and the rise of a parliamentary republic in its’ stead, but through it all the Philharmonie’s doors remained open, putting on as many as 120 concerts per season in the midst of change. 
<br>
<br>
The 1920s were as much an era of change for the Berliner Philharmonie as anything else in Berlin, however. With a change in management due to the retirement of several leaders, the introduction of “Popular-Concerts,” and the same hyperinflation that plagued Germany, the Philharmonic Orchestra found itself in an era of tremendous change. Due to the latter mentioned hyperinflation, the hall also now sat empty for lengths of time, as the Orchestra toured the rest of Europe periodically, seeking currency that was not subject to the same uncertainty as the Mark.
<br>
<br>
<br>
On January 30th, 1944, while rehearsing Beethoven’s Violin Concerto, bombs would fall through the ceiling of the building, heralding a full hour of bombing that would follow, destroying the first Philharmonie’s Concert-Hall along with much of Berlin. It would not be until 1960 that the Hall would have its foundations torn out, and a new hall would be built to stand in its place."
</p>
<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>"At the Hall’s inception, Berlin was far from being known as a musical capital of Europe. Other cities like Vienna and Leipzig were better known for their concert halls and orchestras, however, the initial renting of that retired roller skating rink by an orchestra with a name that existed to mock a conductor marked a turning point for the city and the nation. Across the next 143 years the name “Berlin Philharmonic” would become synonymous with exceptional skill, and the building that stands now stands as a beacon in the heart of modern Berlin, calling to musicians across the world."
