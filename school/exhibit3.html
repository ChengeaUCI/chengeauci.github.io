<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>"The Reichsbahnbunker Friedrichstraße (Boros Collection - Bunker) is a private art collection with a one-of-a-kind approach to contemporary art. It is one of the many pieces of architecture still standing that carries Berlin's rich history embedded with creativity of the modern era. Its purpose has evolved drastically over the years, but to this day the bunker carries with it a heavy and mysterious atmosphere from its origins as an old war bunker."
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul class="lists">
<li>"1942: Constructed by Nazi Germany to shelter up to 3,000 civilians.</li>
<li>1945: Becomes occupied by the Red Army to be used as a war prison.</li>
<li>1949: Becomes a warehouse for textiles.</li>
<li>1957: Used as storage for imported tropical fruit from Cuba. Earning the nickname “Banana Bunker.”</li>
<li>1990: Owned by the Federal Republic of Germany after reunification.</li>
<li>1992: The techno club “Bunker” becomes one of the most important centers of the electro scene. Considered one of the most hardcore clubs in the world because of its fetish and fantasy parties. </li>
<li>2003: Karen and Christian Boros buy the bunker to make their collection of contemporary art accessible to the public in the converted bunker.</li>
<li>2007: Completion of remodelling and opened to the public."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>"The Reichsbahnbunker Friedrichstraße is a place shaped by destruction and cultural transformation. The bunker's atmosphere still feels heavy and grim carrying the history of war from its original purpose in 1942 as a Nazi bomb shelter and in 1945 as a war prison. However its conversion from war bunker to soviet prison to techno club and finally to an art museum reflects Berlin's own embracement of its scars left by war and division. The bunker could have remained a site of fear and relic, however Berliners chose to repurpose this reminder of war into a center of culture and art."
